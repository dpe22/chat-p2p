# Progress report:
- "basicSocketProject" branch has threaded program that could take two clients and connect them to eachother
- client-python and server-python codes are basic socket programming files that can communicate basic messaging features with others
- Since the server.py in basicSocketProgramming branch is unable to recognize users outside the system, we have setup client-python.py and server-python.py to be able to communicate with outside systems
